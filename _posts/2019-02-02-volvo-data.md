# Background

Vovlo Car Group finalized the sales results of 2018 year in official [release](https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/247393/volvo-cars-sets-new-global-sales-record-in-2018-breaks-600000-sales-milestone)
and hit the global record of 600.000 sales.<br>
The major contribution to overall sales growth was driven by China (14.1%) and US (20.6%). In comparison with December'17 we see the slight demand 
slowdown in Europe region (-1.3%) and US (-8.8%). However, total December volumes represent sustainable growth year over year. <br>
To effectively predict auto sales and improve Volvo Group competitiveness we will analyze the monthly data and, 
revealing seasonal flactuations build forecasting model powered by neural network.
